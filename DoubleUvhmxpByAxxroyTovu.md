## Description
 Update to UVHM Plus converted for BL2

 by AxxroyTovu

 NOTE: Removes the DOT damage increase from the Community Patch since removing enemy regen essentially does the same thing.

 Similar to Jim Raven’s UVHM Plus, right now only doubles XP in UVHM, but you can edit the numbers as you see fit.
 V2.0 - Removed enemy regen in UVHM and boosted badass health. Now Badasses should feel more dangerous and there shouldn’t be health regeneration.
