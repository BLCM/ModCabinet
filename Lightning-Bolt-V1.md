## Description
 THE LIGHTNING BOLT
BY BL0C
Replaces the Commerce.   
Changes the barrel to Hyperion, increases magazine size, adds an additional two projectiles, fires e-tech projectiles, and now it comes in all elements. 
Gibbed codes included. 
Note* many assets are borrowed from other acutally talented modders, please don't sue me...:). (Anyone want to make custom skin?)
