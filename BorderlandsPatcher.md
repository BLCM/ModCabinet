# Description
Patcher for borderlands2.exe and borderlandspresequel.exe for ability to use community patch and other mods.

To use Community Patch you need to patch your borderlands2(presequel).exe (it will backup original file, don't worry), add console hotkey if you doesn't have one and place patch file(patch.txt) to Binaries directory. Program will find your game path and download latest patch automaticly, if won't find it, you still can choose path manually. Then launch your game, open console, type "exec Patch.txt"(or PatchOffline.txt if you want to play offline) and press enter. Do it after game downloads all stuff(when you see actual menu). That's all, you can now enjoy patch! It will work only for current session, you need to enter console command every time you launch the game. You can press "Arrow Up" to show your last typed command on console.
