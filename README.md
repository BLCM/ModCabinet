# ModCabinet

The ModCabinet wiki exists to provide a slightly-easier way of browsing through
Borderlands 2/TPS mods, apart from digging through the somewhat-daunting main
github repo.  See the categorized listing by [clicking on this link to get to
the wiki itself](https://github.com/BLCM/ModCabinet/wiki)!

The content of this wiki is auto-generated on a regular basis.  Check the
[Wiki Status](https://github.com/BLCM/ModCabinet/wiki/Wiki-Status) page for
the most recent update time, and any errors which may have occurred during
the wiki generation.

For information on actually building your own mods, the [BLCMods
Wiki](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/wiki) is your best starting point.

# Contributing
