## Description
Leveling Overhaul

Gain 2 Skill Points instead of 1 and increase some skills' maximum grade to 10

NOTE: Salvador's Inconceivable, I'm the Juggernaut, Yippie Ki Yay, 
Maya's Subsequence and Krieg's Numbed Nerves and Fuel the Rampage aren't included.

SECOND NOTE: Gaige's Nth Degree is capped at 8, so every 2nd bullet 
ricochets. I tried to make every bullet ricochet, but the skill didn't work as expected.

WARNING: Activate this mod before loading your character, because if you 
not activate this mod (by accident), you will lose your extra skill points
 (which can be recovered by using Cheat Engine)
