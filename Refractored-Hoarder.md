# Description
I decided to refactor the Hoarder mod so it's a little more useful in terms of money shot chains... 5 Shots or 6 doesn't really work too well with Inconceivable, and I decided that Filled to the Brim wasn't all that used/useful in my builds. Just Got Real is probably more useful than an 80% chance to not consume a large magazine.
If anyone can make a +1/+2/+3 Green-Purple-Blue mod for Inconceivable using the formula's below, feel free to modify it. - Foreststrike
