# Description
Makes every weapon able to spawn with any barrel, element, accessory, etc. of their respective weapon type. Also enables two accessories on nearly all weapons.
Shields, grenades, and relics are also randomized, to various degrees of effctiveness. Not everything will work correctly (or at all).
In short, complete chaos.


SEPARATED VERSIONS;
If you don't want the whole package, there are versions that only randomize weapons, shields, grenades, and relics

DISAPPEARING WEAPONS/ITEMS:
If a weapon/item spawns with a barrel/part from a DLC, and the gun/item itself isn't from that DLC, the barrel/part will disappear the next time you load that save file.

NOTES;
Run this file last if possible.
The game will probably delete 99% of weapons/shields/grenades/relics you obtain during this mod's use, if you do not run the mod before loading a save file where you have used the mod previously.
Highly recommended to run this on a new playthrough, if for no other reason than to not delete items when you run your typical save file without the mod active.
Due to hotfix "brilliance", Aquamarine sniper rifles won't work unless you do the following;
1. Load up a file that doesn't have the Aquamarine sniper rifle, and start up a game.
2. Activate this mod.
3. Exit back to main menu.
4. Activate this mod.
5. Load the file with the Aquamarine sniper rifle on it.
