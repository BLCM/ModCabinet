## How can I add my mods to this wiki and how I can format my mod page correctly?
1. Go to [[Wiki|Home]]
2. Click `New Page`

3. Choose a name(name of your mod usually) and edit page. Here is [[template|TEMPLATE]] with examples and descriptions. You can also check any page formating by clicking `Edit`

After creating a page you probably want to add it to category. You can add them to several categories if you want, just like with tags. To add your page, first of all, check the name of your page in adress bar. It usually the same as you typed, but spaces replaced with `-`. Then go to category you want, click `Edit` and add it with line:
`* [[Mod name|Page-name]] by [author](link-to-authors-directory-in-BLCMods/BLCMods-repository)`

IMPORTANT. Place this line with alphabetical sort in mind, don't just add it to the end of the page
