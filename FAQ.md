## How can I download mods? It gives me a page with text in my browser
Simply press `RMC > Save as...` and save file into `$BORDERLANDSGAME\Binaries` directory. Some mods has install instructions in the `Description`, check them as well.

## Where is the tags?
They didn't work well. Github search is awful for something like this, so we decided to get rid of them(at least for now)

## I'm not a modder/I already addded all my mods here, and I want to contribute. Can I add pages for mods from other authors?
Sure! Most of them already has some info(at the begining of the file or on authors(mods) directory) so you can copypaste this info, format it right and add to a categories.

## How can I add my mods to this wiki and how I can format my mod page correctly?
1. Go to [[Wiki|Home]]
2. Click `New Page`

3. Choose a name(name of your mod usually) and edit page. Here is [template](https://github.com/bugworm/Categories/wiki/TEMPLATE/_edit) (DO NOT EDIT IT, just copy stuff you need to your page) with examples and descriptions. You can also check any page formating by clicking `Edit`

After creating a page you probably want to add it to category. You can add them to several categories if you want, just like with tags. To add your page, first of all, check the name of your page in adress bar. It usually the same as you typed, but spaces replaced with `-`. Then go to category you want, click `Edit` and add it with line:

`* [[Mod name|Page-name]] by [author](link-to-authors-directory-in-BLCMods/BLCMods-repository)`

IMPORTANT. Place this line with alphabetical sort in mind, don't just add it to the end of the page.

## There are plenty of mistakes here/there.
Editing mistakes will be appretiated. Just click `Edit` and fix them.

## I have some ideas about FAQ/Template/general structure.
Create an issue and we will discuss this.
