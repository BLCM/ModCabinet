## Description

TF2 Inspired Utility Weapons pack by AxxroyTovu

Includes:
The BFB - A shotgun that boosts your movement speed - replaces The RokSalt
The Wing Boy - A pistol that boosts your jump height - replaces The Gwen's Head
The Scorcher - A pistol that has significant knockback - replaces The Tinderbox
The Quaker* - A launcher that's great for rocket jumping - replaces The Roaster

* Thanks to Aaron000 for letting me include this in the pack

Note - The Scorcher uses parts that will get deleted by sanity check if you don't run this before loading your save file. Be careful.

Note 2 - The Wing Boy breaks Tenacity relics and Heart of the Ancients, they give ridiculous jump boosts so be careful.
