# How to install
UVHM+ is modularized to an extent, meaning you can choose what to use

EnemyEnhancer/Badassify/Vendor+ are hotfix parts of the mod

	choose between the regular and Extreme version(or choose not to use either), and merge them into your community patch hotfix array(you can see how to merge hotfix below)
	after youre done merging the hotfix

UVHM+ base is the non-hotfix part of the mod

	choose between UVHM+.txt and UVHM+(Speed).txt (once again you can choose not to use either, but I personally recommend it if youre in it for the challenge)
and just execute it after you execute the community patch
